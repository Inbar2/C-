Game code with GUI:
Airplane flying above the sea and dropping parachutists from time to time.
In the water there is a boat awaiting the parachutes. The goal of the game is to save the parachutist from falling
into the water by moving the boat left and right.
Notes:
- You can choose to move the boat using the keyboard or mouse (don't need to implement both).
- If the user catches the parachutist he gets 10 points.
- If the parachutists falls to the water, the user loses 1 live point (starting from 3) and if he loses all life
points the game ends.
